//Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list.

//Note: Empty arrays should return 0.

//P: takes in an array of numbers
//R: return the average (numbers added/ total number of nums)
//E: findAverage([1,1,1]), 1); (findAverage([1,2,3]), 2)
//P: create a function which iterates through an array and adds all of the numbers together. Then divide the total by the length of the array.
