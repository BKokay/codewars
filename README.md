# CodeWars daily practice

This is a repo of my daily coding challenges from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/BKokay).

The purpose is to deliberately exercise my coding muscle every day with the goal of getting better with each challenge.

I reflect on what I learn through the challenges in my [learning journal](www.britkeith.dev/learningjournal)
